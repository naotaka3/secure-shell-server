# Code Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Variable Shadowing Issues**:
   - In `main.go` and `cmd/secure-shell/main.go`, fixed variable shadowing where `err` was redeclared inside the `scriptFile != ""` case block. Changed to use a separate variable name `fileErr` for file opening errors.

2. **Variable Reference Issues**:
   - In `pkg/validator/validator.go`, fixed the use of `err` which was both declared at the top and potentially modified inside the Walk function. Changed to use a separate variable `validationErr` to store validation errors.

## Remaining Issues

1. **Go Module Setup**:
   - We couldn't run `go mod tidy` or build/test commands due to environment restrictions ("module cache not found: neither GOMODCACHE nor GOPATH is set"). This needs to be addressed in a proper Go environment.

2. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - The `mvdan.cc/sh/v3` package was added to go.mod but needs to be properly downloaded and its entry added to go.sum. This requires running `go mod tidy` in a proper Go environment.

## Next Steps

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Set up a proper Go environment with GOPATH or GOMODCACHE configured.

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Run `go mod tidy` to download all dependencies and update go.sum.

3. **Testing**:
   - Run `make test` to verify all tests pass.
   - Run `make lint` to check for any other code issues.

4. **Building**:
   - Run `make build` to build the executable.

## Code Quality Improvements

The code should now be free of basic syntax errors and variable shadowing issues. The main components of the Secure Shell Server are well-structured with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Config Package**: Manages allowed commands and execution settings.
2. **Validator Package**: Validates shell commands against the allowlist.
3. **Runner Package**: Securely executes validated commands.
4. **Logger Package**: Provides detailed logging.

The implementation follows the specified coding rules:
- **Simplicity**: Code is clear and avoids unnecessary features.
- **Modularity**: Components have clear responsibilities.
- **Explicit Error Handling**: Errors are explicitly checked and handled.
- **Reusability**: Functions and packages are designed for reuse.
